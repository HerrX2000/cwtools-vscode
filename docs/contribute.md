CWTools is for the community by the community (mostly by Dayshine tho 😀). Supporting new games or updates are work with which you could help the community.

To use these:
1. Clone this repository to a filepath, e.g. D:\Git\cwtools-ck3-config. (or copy the contents of the zip you can download)
2. Open VS Code, and go to File, Preferences, Settings
2.a. To make the changes only apply to this folder (not all folders on your computer), change the tab at the top to "workspace settings"
3. Set "cwtools.rules_version" to "manual"
4. Set "cwtools.rules_folder" to the path above. e.g. D:\Git\cwtools-ck3-config
5. Re-open VS Code.

Once you make changes to the rules, you can press "Ctrl-shift-p" and select "Reload window" to easily restart the extension.

See https://github.com/tboby/cwtools/wiki/.cwt-config-file-guidance for guidance on the file format
